# Scrapped_data
I have scrapped data using Beautiful Soup of the power banks of a e-commerce website.
The jpg file shows an image of visual data.
The Python file has all the functions to scrap the data from a webpage.
STYLE EXCEL will style it.
It will display the Price and Title of the power banks in excel.
